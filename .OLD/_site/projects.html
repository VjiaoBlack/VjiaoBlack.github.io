        <p>Current Projects:</p>
        <p>This Website - I've been working on this website as a portfolio site for a while now, and I plan on getting quite a bit done until I work on somethinge else again.</p>
        <p>Silent Forest - a 2D fantasy RPG game. Development is still in early stages - the storyline follows a amnesiac prince who struggles to discover his past, only to realize that that is just as malleable as the path to come.</p>
        <p>Last Chance - a remix of many different strategy game elements. Set in outer space right after a devastating explosion that destroys Earth, the player is tasked to take control of the few hundred remaining humans and rebuild a stable settlement, defending it from debris, internal conflicts, and perhaps even aliens.</p>
        <p>Time Keeper - an iOS app that helps people keep track of how they use their time.</p>
        <p>Finished Projects:</p>
        <p>Starlorn - a 2d space shooter, complete with a dynamic upgrade system and a reliable high score and level system.</p>
        <p>Terminvaders - starlorn, but in a terminal! Also supports multiplayer, and three different bullet types.</p>
        <p>Databanks - a terminal-based database system where users can store 'index cards' of data. Databanks also keeps track of dates of creation and has its own search function.</p>

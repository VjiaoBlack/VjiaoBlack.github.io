        <p>Greetings!</p>
        <p>I currently attend the University of Chicago as a computer science major, and attended Stuyvesant High School before that.</p>
        <p>I've been a programming and tech enthusiast since sophomore year of high school, and in my free time, I enjoy attending hackathons and assisting in organizing them, and working on various projects that span games, software, and websites. I have experience with Java, C/C++, HTML/CSS, Javascript, Flask, and MongoDB.</p>
        <p>I also have lots of other hobbies including singing a capella, playing the flute and piano, folding origami, and fencing.</p>
        <p>Feel free to drop me an email or facebook message whenever you feel like it!</p>

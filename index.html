<h2>
	Hi there!
</h2>

<p>
	I'm currently a Software Engineer for <a href="http://www.magicleap.com">
	Magic Leap</a>, working on their Graphics team in Sunnyvale, CA. As a 
	Graphics System Engineer, I work on helping to 
	making sure that the system graphics runs quickly, runs efficiently,
	and produces the high-quality results.
</p>

<p>
	I finished my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science recently
	at <a href="http://www.uchicago.edu">The University of Chicago</a> -- though
	I'm thinking of going back to school after a while for another degree in
	Statistics or Simulation; I'm not sure yet.

</p>

<p>
	I'm interested in machine learning, graphics, and a bunch of other stuff:
	image processing, natural language processing, robotics, video games, 
	singing, origami, and food - just to name a few. 
	I also performed with <a href="http://www.voicesinyourhead.org">Voices in 
	Your Head</a> during my years at UChicago.
</p>

<p>
	Feel free to <a href="mailto:vjiaoblack@gmail.com">send me an email</a> if you want
	to chat, work on something together, or hire me! You can find my resume 
	<a href="/res/Victor_Jiao_Resume.pdf">here</a>.

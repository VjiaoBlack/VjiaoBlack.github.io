<h2>
	Hi there!
</h2>

<p>
	I'm a software engineer in the SF Bay Area; grew up in NYC, went to 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuyvesant_High_School">Stuy</a>, 
	then <a href="http://www.uchicago.edu">UChicago</a>. Now, I do 
	graphics engineering for work (think shaders, OpenGL, and their underlying 
	C++ systems).
</p>

<p>
	I'm into data analytics, games, simulations, and a bunch of other 
	stuff: image processing, natural language processing, robotics, Dungeons 
	and Dragons, singing, origami, and food - just to name a few. I also 
	sang and performed with <a href="http://www.voicesinyourhead.org">Voices
	in Your Head</a> during my years at UChicago, including competing three times at the
	<a href="https://varsityvocals.com/competitions/about-tournaments/">ICCA Finals</a>.

</p>

<p>
	I'm currently working on two games in C++; a pixel-art top-down civilization 
	<a href="http://www.github.com/VjiaoBlack/terrain-gen">simulator</a>, 
	and a tower-defense 
	<a href="http://www.github.com/VjiaoBlack/shape-defense">game</a> 
	along with a from-scratch engine in C++ and SDL2 (soon to be OpenGL). 
	They're both very early stage, but feel free to check them out and make a 
	pull request.
</p>

<p>
	<a href="mailto:vjiaoblack@gmail.com">Send me an email</a> if you want
	to chat, work on something together, or hire me! You can find my resume 
	<a href="/res/Victor_Jiao_Resume.pdf">here</a>.

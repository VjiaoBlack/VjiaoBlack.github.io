<h2>Hi there!</h2>
<p>
	I study Computer Science at <a href="http://www.uchicago.edu">The University of Chicago</a>, 
	and I'm finishing up my BS and MS degrees there this year. 
</p>

<p>
	I'm interested in machine learning, graphics, and a bunch of other stuff: image processing,
	sound generation, robotics, video games, singing, origami, and food - to name a few. 
	I also perform with <a href="http://www.voicesinyourhead.org">Voices in Your Head</a>.
</p>

<p>
	Feel free to <a href="mailto:victorjiao@uchicago.edu">send me an email</a> if you want
	to chat, work on something together, or hire me! You can find my resume 
	<a href="/res/Victor_Jiao_Resume.pdf">here</a>.
